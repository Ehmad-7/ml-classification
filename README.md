# ML Classification – Breast Cancer Prediction

## Problem
Predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using supervised machine learning.

## Dataset
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (scikit-learn)
- Binary classification problem

## Model
- Logistic Regression

## Evaluation
- Metric: Accuracy
- Result: (Accuracy: 0.96)

## Additional Models Tested
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree

## Observations
- Logistic Regression performed consistently well
- KNN accuracy depends on value of K
- Decision Tree can overfit if not controlled

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## What I Learned
- Difference between regression and classification
- Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using accuracy
